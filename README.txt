HOW TO RUN:

There are 3 parameters: size, empty_positions, and max_levels.

SIZE 		- The size of the game board. If you input n, the board will be nxn.
EMPTY_POSITIONS - Number of positions on the board that must remain empty. Once all 
		  allowable positions have been filled, players have the option to move
 		  existing pieces into empty spaces, thereby not adding any more tiles.
MAX_LEVELS 	- The level of the computer's difficulty. Higher difficulty means a slower 		  game.

Outcomes: The computer can win, the human player can win, or it can be a draw.
